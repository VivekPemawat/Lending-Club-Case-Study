## General Information
- This case study focuses on analyzing loan data to reduce the credit loss by identifying factors that contribute to loan defaults.
- Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, providing personal and business loans, as well as financing for medical procedures.
- The dataset contains information about past loans and their outcomes, where borrowers who have defaulted on their loans are labelled as 'charged-off' or 'defaulters'.

## Goal
- The goal of this project is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to minimize the risk of credit loss by identifying driving factors for loan default.

## Context of Problem
- Lending Club offers loans at lower interest rates through an easy-to-use online platform.
- The primary issue is credit loss, which occurs when borrowers default on their loans. This loss is significant for lenders, and identifying risky applicants is critical.
- The borrowers who default are labelled as 'charged-off' and contribute the most to the financial losses for the lender.

## Target
- The aim is to reduce credit loss by finding factors that contribute to loan default using EDA techniques.

## Risk Associated with the Problem
- If an applicant is likely to repay the loan and the loan is not approved, it results in a loss of business (rejecting loans for non-defaulting applicants).
- If an applicant is not likely to repay the loan and the loan is approved, it leads to financial loss (approving loans for defaulting applicants).

## Technologies Used
- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook 
- MATLAB 
- NumPy

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1: Key factors driving loan defaults were identified through data analysis.
- Conclusion 2: Applicants with specific credit scores and loan amounts were found to be more prone to default.
- Conclusion 3: Default risk is higher in certain loan types and terms.
- Conclusion 4: Applicants from certain geographic regions or employment sectors showed higher default rates.

## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the need to minimize financial loss in lending.
